## What is the Floorbin Design AI Generator? {#what-is-it}

The Floorbin Design AI Generator is a specialized tool that creates professional retail display concepts for IQOS TEREA products using artificial intelligence. Instead of waiting days or weeks for design teams to create multiple concepts, you can now generate high-quality floorbin designs in minutes.

### What is a Floorbin?
A floorbin is a free-standing retail display unit placed on the store floor to showcase products. For IQOS TEREA, these are typically multi-tiered displays that showcase:
- Product boxes at different levels
- IQOS ILUMA devices
- Pricing information
- Product branding and messaging
- Launch dates and promotional information

### Why Use AI for Floorbin Design?

**Traditional Process:**
- Multiple rounds of design feedback (7+ iterations typical)
- Professional 3D rendering for each concept
- Weeks of back-and-forth between teams
- High costs for early concept exploration

**AI-Powered Process:**
- Generate concepts in 30-60 seconds
- Test multiple design directions quickly
- Explore different color schemes instantly
- Save time and budget on early-stage ideation
- Focus design resources on refining the best concepts

- **Refinement Phase**: Use gpt-image-1 (better quality)
- **Final Concepts**: Use gpt-image-1 or DALL-E 3 HD

**Generation Strategy:**
- Generate multiple concepts in one session
- Batch similar requests together
- Download everything - you can't retrieve later
- Use lower quality for quick tests
- Use HD for presentation-ready

**Typical Costs** (Check current OpenAI pricing):
- DALL-E 2: ~$0.02 per image
- DALL-E 3 Standard: ~$0.04 per image
- DALL-E 3 HD: ~$0.08 per image
- gpt-image-1: Check OpenAI pricing page

**Budget Example:**
- 10 explorations (DALL-E 2): $0.20
- 5 refinements (gpt-image-1): Variable
- 3 final (DALL-E 3 HD): $0.24
- **Total: Under $1 for full concept exploration**

## Common Questions {#common-questions}

### General Questions

**Q: How long does it take to generate a design?**
A: 30-60 seconds per design. The actual generation happens on OpenAI servers, so time depends on server load.

**Q: Can I generate multiple designs at once?**
A: Only with DALL-E 2 (up to 4 variations). gpt-image-1 and DALL-E 3 generate one at a time.

**Q: Will the product look exactly like my reference image?**
A: The tool is designed to preserve product appearance from reference images. However, AI interpretation means slight variations may occur. Always review results carefully.

**Q: Can I save my settings for next time?**
A: Currently, settings are not saved between sessions. Take screenshots of successful configurations for reference.

**Q: Is this replacing designers?**
A: No. This tool is for early concept exploration. Professional designers are still essential for final production-ready designs, proper typography, exact brand guidelines, and manufacturing specifications.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What's the difference between the AI models?**
A:
- **gpt-image-1**: Newest, best quality, most intelligent
- **DALL-E 3**: High quality, great for detailed work
- **DALL-E 2**: Faster, can do multiple variations, lower cost

**Q: What does "Quality: Auto" mean?**
A: For gpt-image-1, the AI automatically chooses the best quality level based on your prompt complexity and requirements.

**Q: Why are my images different each time?**
A: AI has inherent randomness. Each generation is a new interpretation. This is normal and expected.

**Q: Can I get the exact same design again?**
A: No. AI generation is not deterministic. Always download designs you like immediately.

**Q: Why does generation sometimes fail?**
A: Common reasons:
- API key issues
- OpenAI server problems
- Prompt too complex
- Network connectivity
- Model temporarily unavailable

### Design Questions

**Q: Can I specify exact product placement?**
A: AI interprets rather than follows exact spatial specifications. You can influence through design elements selection, but exact placement requires manual design.

**Q: Will the brand font be correct?**
A: No. AI cannot access specific brand fonts. Typography will be inspired by your tone selection but needs manual refinement for brand accuracy.

**Q: Can I request specific TEREA characters or mascots?**
A: AI is best at creating original interpretations rather than replicating specific brand characters. For established brand assets, use reference images or manual design.

**Q: How do I get Japanese text on the floorbin?**
A: The tool automatically includes Japanese text for authenticity, but it may not be accurate or legible. Professional translation and design is recommended for final versions.

**Q: Can I adjust the design after generation?**
A: Not within this tool. Download the image and work with designers in Photoshop, Illustrator, or 3D software for adjustments.

### Workflow Questions

**Q: Should I show these to my boss?**
A: Yes, as "initial concept explorations" or "design direction options." Set clear expectations these are starting points, not final designs.

**Q: How many variations should I generate?**
A: Recommended approach:
- 3-5 for tone exploration
- 2-3 for color refinement
- 2-3 finals for selection
- Total: 7-11 concepts typical

**Q: Can I use these for final production?**
A: No. Use these for:
- Stakeholder presentations
- Design team briefing
- Concept exploration
- Campaign planning

Then work with designers for production-ready files.

**Q: What file format will I get?**
A: PNG format, high resolution, suitable for presentations and as design references.

**Q: Can I edit the downloaded image?**
A: Yes. PNG files can be opened in any image editing software. However, they're raster images (pixels), not vector, so scaling up may reduce quality.

### Color & Customization Questions

**Q: Why don't my exact brand colors appear?**
A: The AI interprets your hex codes but lighting, materials, and rendering may shift apparent colors slightly. This is why final design refinement is important.

**Q: Can I use my company's brand colors?**
A: Absolutely! Use the color pickers to enter your exact brand hex codes.

**Q: What if I don't know hex codes?**
A: Use the color picker visual selector. Click anywhere on the color gradient. You can also search online for "color picker" tools to find hex codes from images.

**Q: Do I have to use the preset color palettes?**
A: No. Presets are suggestions. You can ignore them and use only your custom color pickers.

**Q: Can I create a gradient background?**
A: Select "Gradient Background" from color presets and the AI will interpret this creatively. Exact gradient control requires manual design.

### Product & Reference Image Questions

**Q: What if I don't have a product photo yet?**
A: You can still generate concepts, but the product representation will be AI's interpretation rather than accurate. Results will be less brand-accurate.

**Q: Can I upload multiple product photos?**
A: Currently, only one reference image at a time. Choose your best hero shot.

**Q: What resolution should my reference image be?**
A: Higher is better. Minimum 800x800 pixels recommended. 2000x2000+ pixels ideal.

**Q: Will the uploaded image affect generation time?**
A: No. Upload size doesn't significantly impact generation time.

**Q: Can I remove the reference image and regenerate?**
A: Yes. Delete it and regenerate for AI's interpretation without product reference.

### Troubleshooting Questions

**Q: What does "API Key Error" mean?**
A: Your OpenAI key is missing, invalid, or has no credit. Contact your IT team or whoever manages the API account.

**Q: Generation failed - what do I do?**
A:
1. Check your API key is entered correctly
2. Verify your internet connection
3. Try a simpler prompt (fewer design elements)
4. Wait a few minutes and try again
5. Try a different AI model

**Q: The design looks nothing like I expected. Why?**
A: Review your settings:
- Is the correct Design Tone selected?
- Did the reference image upload successfully?
- Are your custom colors set correctly?
- Is the product name correct?

Try regenerating with adjusted settings.

**Q: Text in the design is gibberish. Is this normal?**
A: Yes. AI-generated text is rarely accurate. This is why professional typography is needed for final designs. Focus on overall visual direction, not text accuracy.

**Q: The product looks wrong/distorted. What happened?**
A: If you uploaded a reference image:
- Verify it uploaded successfully
- Check image quality and clarity
- Try uploading a different photo
- Ensure product is clearly visible in reference

If no reference image:
- AI is imagining the product
- Upload a reference for accuracy

**Q: Can I report a bug or request a feature?**
A: Contact your tool administrator or IT team with:
- Screenshot of the issue
- Exactly what you were trying to do
- What happened vs. what you expected
- Your settings at the time
